## **Requirements**

## Introduction
This is the case study of seat heat monitoring system . In  this seat heat monitoring system the sensor will sense the presence of person in the seat and changes the temperature accordingly. If the person is seated and node/ switch has been pressed then only temperature for the seat can be updated ,else if either the person has not been seated or the switch has not been pressed then the temperature cannot be updated for seat. 

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are: 
* To design and develop the system which is capable of sensing the presence of person and seat heat monitoring and displaying the PWM signal.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strength
 * User friendly.
 * Capable of determining the presence of person on the seat.
 * Simple designing.
 * It is easy to modify  the temperature value.
 
 ### Weakness
 *  The seat heat can be modified if the person seats and switch has been pressed.
 * The system can be used only in low temperature regions.
 
 ### Opportunities
 
 * This project provides  comfort to the person seated by giving a chance to modify the temperature.
 * It could be best to be implemented by replacing the heater with air conditioner.

### Threats
This project may not be useful in high temperature regions.

## **4 W's and 1 H**

## Who

Anyone who travels  in low temperature regions can be helpfull by use this application .

## What

This project is concerned about developing a seat heat monitoring system for the person who uses vechicle to travel .

## When
Mostly in the low temperature regions this project can be useful because, seat of the  person make them feel comfortable during driving by providing them warmness.

## Why

The design  of the project is simple and low cost . Its beneficial to use because of the robust system

## How
By allowing the person to seat and modify the temperature of the seat as he required.

## Basic requirements that very essential are
